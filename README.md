# *Offline-First Learning App for Rural Communities*  
*Tagline: *Learning Beyond Connectivity

## *Project Description*  
An offline-first Android learning app designed for rural areas like Araku Valley with limited or no internet access. The app syncs educational content (videos, ebooks, quizzes) from a local XAMPP-MySQL server installed at a central point (panchayat office). Users can access content offline and sync via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth when near the server.

- *Backend*: PHP (via XAMPP)  
- *Database*: MySQL (server-side), SQLite (offline app storage)  
- *APIs*: REST API for app-server communication  
- *Local Server*: XAMPP (Apache + PHP + MySQL) on low-cost hardware (Raspberry Pi/PC)  
- *Connectivity*: Wi-Fi/Bluetooth for offline syncing  
- *Tools*: Canva (content creation), Figma (UI/UX design)

## *How It Works*

1. Panchayat office hosts a local server (XAMPP + MySQL) with educational content.  
2. Users sync content to their Android app via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth when near the server.  
3. Users can access courses, ebooks, and quizzes fully offline.  
4. Completed quizzes and content requests sync back to the server on the next visit.
