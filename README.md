Offline-first Learning App for Rural Areas 
Offline-first Learning App for Rural Areas  Use Case: Develop an app providing downloadable educational content and quizzes that work without internet connectivity.   We are from visakhapatnam ,we are having a hill station and valleys named as araku valley. We recently went there and enjoyed a lot, During our visit we faced many issues regarding internet  when we were coming back we got a thought how would people access resources , we observed most of them having mobiles but no standard intent connectivity it was fluctuating again and again  So, we decided to create a solution for the beautiful rural places with less internet connectivity  Our idea is to install a server at village or valley panchayat office where it manages the all the content like courses,quizzes,ebooks,assignments and by using the server, user can access the resources in their mobiles . If someone from the local area request a book or a course related content ,then server at panchayat office receives a request . whenever the office gets the internet connectivity they download the requested content and upload into server.
